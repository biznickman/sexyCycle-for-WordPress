== Description ==

sexyCycle is a lightweight yet very sleek jQuery plugin for making sliding image galleries. And to quote it's creator: "One of the good things about sexyCycle is that you're not forced to stick with a fixed width of all images. It's actually quite nice to use different width on each image."

This WordPress plugin makes it possible to add this image sliding functionality to galleries in WP, you can simply just override the `[gallery]` shortcode generated by WP or you can use it's own `[sexy-gallery]` shortcode. Galleries are handled the same way as usual by the 'Add an Image -> Gallery function'. For best result all images should have the same height; if images have different heights the gallery will cut images larger than the first image.

Examples of sexyCycle in action can be seen at [sexyCycle image jQuery plugin](http://www.suprb.com/apps/sexyCycle/).
